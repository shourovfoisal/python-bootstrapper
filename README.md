## Python VENV Bootstrapper Code

**To run:**

1. Download the `main.sh` file and place in the project directory.
2. Make the file executable by running the command 'chmod +x main.sh'.
2. Create a `dependencies.txt` at the same level as the `main.sh` and put your dependencies there. (There is a sample in this repo)
3. Edit the `main.sh` file and append your code in the 'Your Code' section
4. Run the `main.sh` file. A venv will be created with the desired dependencies, and your code will be executed right after it.
